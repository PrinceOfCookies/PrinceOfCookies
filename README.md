# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

I'm **PrinceOfCookies**, a 17-year-old developer who likes coding, gaming, and content creation. I love playing **Garry's Mod** and **Minecraft**, and I mainly code in **Lua** and **JavaScript**.

## Projects

Here are a few of my favorite projects:

- **[TS-CookieLang](https://github.com/PrinceOfCookies/TS-CookieLang)**: This is a project that I enjoyed working on, I thought it was cool being able to make a "language" with type script, although I never finished it sadly
- **[CookieOS](https://github.com/PrinceOfCookies/CookieOS)**: This is a project for a Minecraft mod called [CC:Tweaked](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked), this replaced a couple of base functions with CC:Tweaked, gives a few new programs to play around with, and a basic UI

### Ongoing Projects

- **Low Sodium Hit System** (Private): I'm involved in developing the hit system for a Garry's Mod server called **Low Sodium**. I also take suggestions from the community, so feel free to [join us on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BTjYMp3FWe)!
- **Skibidiware** (Private): ðŸ¤«

## Content Creation

Apart from programmimg, I'm also a **YouTuber**! Check out my channel [here](https://youtube.com/@princeofcookies?si=1ZGVREywISFAEnwY), where I share videos of me playing games (usually TF2) that are either edited by me, or my good friend [Lifeline](https://youtube.com/@lifeline4603?si=kLRxeJZixrmkvfaM)
